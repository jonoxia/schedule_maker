HANDS-ON EXERCISE:
SENIOR FULL STACK ENGINEER
AT HOME CODING CHALLENGE
Please spend no more than 4 hours on this exercise. If you have any questions, please reach out to the
recruiter at CEL for assistance.
INSTRUCTIONS
Implement a server-side application and simple user interface for creating and viewing scheduled
events, using Python as the server-side technology. You may use the technology of your choice for
the UI.
REQUIREMENTS
Scheduled events must have a name and a specific start time and duration.
Scheduled events may occur once, or may repeat weekly at the same time on one or more specific
days of the week as specified by the user. For example, a user may choose to schedule an event to
occur at the same time every Monday and Wednesday.
No more than one event may be scheduled to occur at a given day and time.
The UI must be compatible with current browser versions of at least Chrome and Firefox.
The UI must allow the user to view the set of previously scheduled events and to add a new event.
The application must include a README with instructions for building and running the application
We expect scheduled events to persist across browsers and sessions, but feel free to accomplish this
in whatever way you think is best given the exercise constraints.
There is no requirement for you to containerize your submission. However, you may optionally
Dockerize your submission; please do not use any other containerization technology.
Clearly state all of the assumptions you made in completing the application
